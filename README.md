# Count Down to Christmas Fitbit App.

Code for my app, available in the Fitbit App Gallery under the name `Xmas Timer`.

This is my first Fitbit app. It displays the number of days counting down until next Christmas. On Christmas day, it will display a festive message! 

The code is written in JavaScript, and the app gets the current date and subtracts it from 25th Dec. There is a corner case whereby if the date is after christmas and yet before New Years Day, it subtracts from the Christmas of the following year.
